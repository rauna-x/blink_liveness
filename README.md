# 🚗 SafePilot – AI Driver Fatigue Detection System

SafePilot is a real-time AI-based Driver Monitoring System (DMS) designed to prevent road accidents caused by driver drowsiness and fatigue.

It uses computer vision and facial landmark analysis to detect:

- 👁 Eye closure (EAR)
- 📊 PERCLOS (Percentage of Eye Closure over time)
- 😮 Yawning detection (MAR)
- 🤕 Head nod detection
- 🚨 Multi-level fatigue alert system (Beep + High Alarm)

The system is optimized for offline edge deployment and can be integrated into vehicles such as trucks, buses, and cars.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Drowsy driving is one of the leading causes of highway accidents, especially in long-haul trucking.

Existing advanced Driver Monitoring Systems are:
- Expensive
- Hardware dependent
- Not accessible in developing regions

SafePilot aims to provide a low-cost AI-based fatigue detection solution using standard cameras and edge computing.

## 🔬 Core Detection Logic

### 1️⃣ Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)
Detects prolonged eye closure using landmark distance calculations.

### 2️⃣ PERCLOS
Tracks percentage of closed-eye frames over time window.

### 3️⃣ Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR)
Detects yawning based on mouth openness ratio.

### 4️⃣ Head Nod Detection
Monitors vertical head displacement to detect micro-sleep head drops.

### 5️⃣ Multi-Level Alert System
- Mild fatigue → Warning Beep
- Severe fatigue → High-intensity alarm
